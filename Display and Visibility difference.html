<!--

there u go:- To have an element take up the space that it would normally take, but without actually rendering anything, use the visibility property instead.

block
The element generates a block element box, generating line breaks both before and after the element when in the normal flow.

inline
The element generates one or more inline element boxes that do not generate line breaks before or after themselves. In normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there is space

none
Turns off the display of an element so that it has no effect on layout (the document is rendered as though the element did not exist). All descendant elements also have their display turned off.
